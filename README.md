# Video-Hard-Cut-Detection
An efficient and robust cuts detection algorithm for video sequences using Digital Image  Processing (DIP).
The algorithm combines spatial and temporal analysis techniques to accurately identify and 
locate cut transitions within video frames. Spatial analysis involves image differencing, thresholding, edge 
detection, and motion analysis.

# Highly accurate and robust in calculations of Histogram , Cut detection at every frame.
Scripts are being provided for sampling and measuring the accurate proficiency.
